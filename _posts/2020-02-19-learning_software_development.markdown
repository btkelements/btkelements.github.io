Software development is something that looks very intriguing and even intimidating from the outside in. However, once you're able to read and understand code, no matter how simple the code may be, you get a small rush of excitement. The cycle from there only gets more addictive as you attempt to construct your own code. The learning is uphill like anything but the subject makes you ask for more when you don't understand something. I'm very interested by linguistics and expanding and honing that skill is a hobby of mine. I have slowly started to see programming languages under the same lens of acquiring new languages.

I had myriad reasons for wanting to learn software development. The prospect of always learning and improving in a career field is something that is very exciting to me. Being able to build something for me or even someone else is another one of many reasons as to why I want to learn software development. This reason is after the fact I started learning but I breath problem solving and really enjoy the process of going from completely lost to that "Ooohhhh," moment.
